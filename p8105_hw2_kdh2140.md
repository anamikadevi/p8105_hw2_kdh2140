Data Science Homework 2
================

The following libraries will be used throughout the homework.

``` r
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet according to homework
specifications.

``` r
trash_wheel = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)))
```

Read and clean the precipitation data for 2017 and 2018 according to
homework.

``` r
precipitation_18 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B15", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

precipitation_17 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B15", col_names = TRUE) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

The Mr. Trash Wheel dataset consists of 344 rows and 14 columns. It
includes the variables: dumpster, month, year, date, weight\_tons,
volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette\_butts,
glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags, chip\_bags, sports\_balls,
homes\_powered. The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017
is XX.

## Problem 2

Read and clean the NYC transit data according to homework
specifications.

``` r
nyc_transit = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```
