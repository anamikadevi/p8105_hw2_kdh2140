Data Science Homework 2
================
Kristina Howell

The following libraries will be used throughout the homework.

``` r
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet according to homework
specifications.

``` r
trash_wheel = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls), 
         sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))

#Another range argument: range = cell_cols("A:N")
```

Read and clean the precipitation data for 2018 and 2017 according to
homework.

``` r
prec_18 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B15") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  rename(prec = total) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)
  
  #alternate argument, skip = 1, to skip the first row of table
  
prec_17 = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
                         sheet = "2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B15") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  rename(prec = total) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Merge the two datasets

``` r
precip_df = bind_rows(prec_18, prec_17)


#Argument to convert numerical month into words

#month_df = 
  #tibble( 
    #month_num = 1:12, 
    #month_name = month.name)

#left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

The Mr. Trash Wheel dataset consists of 344 rows and 14 columns. It
includes the variables: dumpster, month, year, date, weight\_tons,
volume\_cubic\_yards, plastic\_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette\_butts,
glass\_bottles, grocery\_bags, chip\_bags, sports\_balls,
homes\_powered. The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017
is XX.

## Problem 2

Read and clean the NYC transit data according to homework
specifications.

``` r
nyc_transit = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, entrance_type, vending, ada)
```

Convert the entry variable from character to logical

The nyc\_transit database contains the variables: line, station\_name,
station\_latitude, station\_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4,
route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry,
entrance\_type, vending, ada. It contains 1868 rows and 19 columns.

The data cleaning steps have included cleaning the names, using the
clean\_names() function, and selecting the variables to keep in the data
set, using gthe select() function. I then converted the character
variable, entry, into a logical vector, using …

The data is mostly tidy, but the columns regarding route number could be
improved.

There are 465 distinct stations within the data set. Of these 465
stations, 356
